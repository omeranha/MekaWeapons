# Mekanism: Weapons

**Mekanism: Weapons** is an unofficial addon for [Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism), introducing two advanced, highly customizable weapons that blend seamlessly with the iconic "Meka" item aesthetic.

## Weapons

- **Meka-Tana**: A high-tech katana capable of dealing massive damage and teleporting the player.
- **Meka-Bow**: An advanced bow that elevates ranged combat with unique features and modular upgrades.

Both weapons support exclusive modules, including:
- **Weapon Attack Amplification Unit**: Increases damage up to 4x (configurable).
- **Looting Unit**: Functions like the Looting enchantment, up to level 5.

## Meka-Bow Modules

- **Auto Fire**: Enables continuous, automatic arrow shooting.
- **Drawspeed**: Reduces the time required to fully draw the bow for quicker shots.
- **Gravity Dampener**: Modifies arrow trajectory for improved accuracy and range, allowing arrows to fly straight.
- **Energy Arrows**: Fires arrows made of pure energy, removing the need for ammunition.

## Meka-Tana Modules

- **Sweeping**: Grants sweeping attacks, hitting multiple targets at once.
- **Teleportation**: Allows the player to teleport short distances, adding mobility and tactical options.

## Additional Features

- **Wireless Charger (formerly Magnetizer)**: 
  - Charges items in your inventory.
  - When equipped in a Curios slot, visually displays the Meka-Bow and Meka-Tana on your characterâ€™s back for added personalization.

## Customization & Expansion

- The mod is designed for extensibility: new weapons, equipment, and modules (including custom or enchantment-based modules) can be added.
- Suggestions and contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/omeranha/MekaWeapons).
